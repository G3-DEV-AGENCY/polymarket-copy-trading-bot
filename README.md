## Installation

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js** 18+ and **npm**
* **MongoDB** (running locally or remote)

* **Polymarket Account** with API access

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BlackSkyorg/polymarket-copytrading-bot.git
cd Polymarket-copy-trading-bot-2025-12
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Create environment configuration:**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# Target user wallet address to copy trades from
USER_ADDRESS=0xYourTargetWalletAddress

# Your wallet address (proxy wallet) that will execute trades
PROXY_WALLET=0xYourProxyWalletAddress

# Private key of your proxy wallet (64 hex characters, NO 0x prefix)
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here

# Polymarket CLOB API URLs
CLOB_HTTP_URL=https://clob.polymarket.com
CLOB_WS_URL=wss://clob-ws.polymarket.com

# MongoDB connection string
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/polymarket_copytrading

# Polygon RPC URL (for checking balances)
RPC_URL=https://polygon-rpc.com

# USDC contract address on Polygon
USDC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x2791Bca1f2de4661ED88A30C99A7a9449Aa84174

# Optional: Configuration defaults
FETCH_INTERVAL=1
TOO_OLD_TIMESTAMP=24
RETRY_LIMIT=3
```

4. **Start MongoDB:**
```bash
# Windows
net start MongoDB

# Linux/Mac
sudo systemctl start mongod
# or
mongod
```

5. **Start the bot:**
```bash
# Development mode (with ts-node)
npm run dev

# Or build and run
npm run build
npm start
```

On first launch, API credentials are automatically created/derived from your wallet.

## Usage

### Start Copy Trading

```bash
npm run dev
```

The bot will:

1. Connect to MongoDB
2. Initialize CLOB client and create/derive API keys
3. Start trade monitor (fetches trades every X seconds)
4. Start trade executor (processes pending trades)
5. Monitor target wallet and execute copy trades automatically

### Expected Output

When running successfully, you should see:
```
MongoDB connected
Target User Wallet address is: 0x...
My Wallet address is: 0x...
API Key created/derived
Trade Monitor is running every 1 seconds
Executing Copy Trading
Waiting for new transactions...
```

### Trade Execution Flow

1. **Monitor**: Fetches user activities from Polymarket API
2. **Filter**: Identifies new TRADE type activities
3. **Store**: Saves new trades to MongoDB
4. **Execute**: Reads pending trades and determines action (buy/sell/merge)
5. **Match**: Compares positions between target wallet and your wallet
6. **Trade**: Executes orders via CLOB client
7. **Update**: Marks trades as processed in database

---

## Execution Logic

### Trade Lifecycle

1. **Fetch Activities**: Monitor target wallet via Polymarket Data API
2. **Filter Trades**: Identify TRADE type activities only
3. **Check Duplicates**: Verify trade hasn't been processed before
4. **Validate Timestamp**: Ignore trades older than configured threshold
5. **Save to Database**: Store new trades in MongoDB
6. **Read Pending Trades**: Query database for unprocessed trades
7. **Fetch Positions**: Get current positions for both wallets
8. **Get Balances**: Check USDC balances for both wallets
9. **Determine Condition**: Decide on buy/sell/merge based on positions
10. **Execute Order**: Place order via CLOB client using appropriate strategy
11. **Update Status**: Mark trade as processed in database

### Trading Strategies

* **Buy Strategy**: When target wallet buys, calculate position size based on balance ratio
* **Sell Strategy**: When target wallet sells, match the sell proportionally
* **Merge Strategy**: When target wallet closes position but you still hold, sell your position
* **Error Handling**: Retry failed orders up to RETRY_LIMIT, then mark as failed

* Liquidity and slippage risks apply
* Gas fees incurred on every transaction
* WebSocket or API outages may impact execution

**Best Practices**:

* Start with low multipliers
* Enforce strict max order sizes
* Monitor balances regularly
* Test using dry-run modes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"USER_ADDRESS is not defined"**
   - Check your `.env` file exists and has all required variables

2. **"MongoDB connection error"**
   - Ensure MongoDB is running
   - Verify `MONGO_URI` is correct

3. **"Cannot find module '@polymarket/clob-client'"**
   - Run `npm install` to install dependencies

4. **"invalid hexlify value"**
   - Check `PRIVATE_KEY` is 64 hex characters without `0x` prefix

5. **"API Key creation failed"**
   - Verify `PRIVATE_KEY` matches `PROXY_WALLET`
   - Ensure wallet has proper permissions

### Testing

Before running in production:
1. Monitor first few trades carefully
2. Verify MongoDB is storing trades correctly
3. Check order execution logs
